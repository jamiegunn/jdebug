# Testing

## Running the suite

```sh
tests/run-tests.sh
```

Self-contained: no framework, no cluster, no network. The suite (~390
assertions) finishes in under a minute and exits non-zero on any failure —
safe for CI and pre-commit alike. GitHub Actions runs it on every push, on
**both Ubuntu and macOS**, because GNU/BSD userland differences (sed, tar,
ls) have produced real bugs here before.

**Be clear about what this suite proves.** It proves user-facing messages,
confirm gates, exit codes, and (since the adversarial review) end-to-end
capture plumbing — real bytes at the printed path, a manifest entry, kubectl
actually invoked — **against a mock kubectl**. It does not prove real
transport (exec/cp over an API server), real JVM attach behavior, or real
image quirks. Those live in two further layers that are **run manually, not
in CI**: `tests/live/run-live-tests.sh` (real JVM, fake transport) and
`tests/integration/run-kind-tests.sh` (real cluster — one green run against
k3s so far). See [architecture](architecture) (Phase 5) for exact status.

## How it works

`tests/mocks/kubectl` and `tests/mocks/curl` sit first on `PATH` and are
scripted with environment variables, so every failure mode is reproducible
in milliseconds:

| variable | values | simulates |
|---|---|---|
| `MOCK_KUBECTL` | `ok` · `x509` · `refused` · `noctx` · `unauthorized` | cluster reachability / credential outcomes |
| `MOCK_PODS` | `one` · `none` · `multi` | what the selector matches |
| `MOCK_EXEC_OUT` | any string | what an in-pod command prints |
| `MOCK_EXEC` | `wrongcontainer` · `noshell` | kubectl-exec failures (bad container name, distroless image) |
| `MOCK_ACTUATOR` | `secured` · `absent` · `badpage` | actuator 401 / 404 / login-page outcomes |
| `MOCK_EVENTS` | `forbidden` | events RBAC denial |
| `MOCK_HTTP` | `ok` · `fail` | the pod's actuator (for `jdebug-local`) |
| `MOCK_LOG` | file path | records every kubectl invocation for assertions |

## What's covered — and the philosophy

The **user-facing text is the contract**. Tests assert that error messages
explain themselves ("TLS certificate isn't trusted… Rancher Desktop… the
fix"), that raw kubectl noise is suppressed, that every `--confirm` gate
holds, that warnings fire (`ROOT` at `TRACE` warns about volume), and that
the TUI keeps a failed command's output on screen — that last one is a
regression test for a real bug where failures skipped the pause and wiped
their own error.

Coverage map:

- syntax of every script (bash + POSIX sh)
- CLI basics, exit codes, unknown-input handling
- `check_cluster` translation of all four failure classes (TLS, refused,
  no-context, expired credentials)
- `doctor` healthy / unreachable / no-pods verdicts
- multi-pod announcement and listing
- `dumps` listings, analyzer hints, data-handling warning
- all heap-dump confirm gates (four entry points)
- `jdebug-local` end to end against mock HTTP: health, metrics, memory math,
  heap write + extraction hint, jcmd guidance, actuator-down messaging
- TUI: menus, glossary, wizard, session log, context/pod pickers, quick-picks
- `install.sh` symlink round-trip (including running through the symlink)

## Adding a test

Append to the relevant section of `tests/run-tests.sh`:

```bash
MOCK_KUBECTL=refused run_case ./jdebug health
assert_rc  "my case: exits 3" 3
assert_has "my case: says why" "nothing answered"
```

`run_case` captures stdout+stderr+exit code; `assert_has` / `assert_not` /
`assert_rc` do the checking. Mocks can grow new branches — keep them dumb and
env-driven, and remember the mock's `case` matching is **first-case-wins**:
put specific patterns above generic ones (the mock's own header says so too).

Adding a whole new **verb**? The full path is: a new `section` in
`run-tests.sh`, possibly a new mock branch (respect pattern order), and —
easy to forget — regenerate the CLI-surface goldens once the verb appears in
`--help`: `scripts/freeze-spec.sh`, then review the `spec/` diff.

(The canonical list of `MOCK_*` variables is the header comment of
`tests/mocks/kubectl` — the table above is a summary.)

## Manual verification drill

Mocks can't prove cluster reality. Before a release, against a disposable
cluster (kind/k3d) running any Spring Boot app:

1. `jdebug doctor` — all green
2. `jdebug threads` on a **wget-only** JRE-alpine image (tier 1 portability)
3. `jdebug heap --confirm --via jattach` (tier 2, uid parity)
4. `jdebug threads --via jdk` (tier 3, ephemeral containers)
5. `jdebug snapshot` and open the bundle
6. menu: `t` context switch, pod pin with 2+ replicas, `w` one full wizard flow
